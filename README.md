This application provides an endpoint that takes a userid as a parameter. The parameter is checked to be numeric and if this is numeric then we query a mongodb for users and look for that userid. If the userid is not found we response with a message stating so. If the userid is found then we check to make sure they are over 21 and if they are not send back a blank response, otherwise we send back their information in json format.
